        <h1>What is Freestyling?</h1>
        <p>Freestyling in Rocket League is a term used to describe a style of play where players perform aerial maneuvers and acrobatic tricks in an attempt to score goals or make impressive plays. It involves using the game's physics and advanced control techniques to perform aerial stunts, spins, flips, and other complex maneuvers while airborne. This style originally began in early 2011 when the first freestyle goal was recorded and posted.</p>

            <p>Freestyling has evolved to the point where, even if you play rocket league, you may not understand what is happening in the slightest. You could say that some have perfected this art form, but what makes freestyling beautiful is that it's impossible to truly perfect it. Like profesional competitive rocket league, freestyling teams have emerged, the most prominent of which being the pulse clan.</p>

        <p>The other and final facet of freestyling is called competitive clip hitting. This is when a player mainly freestyles in the competitive playlist where play is faster, and attempts to freestyle on people of their rank, when those players are trying to win. This freestyling is much more fast paced and sometimes even more precise than regular freestyling. This is what the mechanical gods such as Pulse Evample do in their free time.</p>
