        <h1>My Progress in Rocket league</h1>
        <p>I got Rocket league in the summer of 2019, but began playing it often in the fall of that year. I grew up
            playing
            sports and playing car video games, and Rocket League seemed to be the perfect mix between the 2. I began
            playing on my xbox for a long time, but never made it through Platinum. I was stuck in platinum for 8
            months, but finally, something changed.</p>
        <p> In 2020, Epic Games buys out Psyonix. Epic games then makes Rocket League a free to play game on all
            platforms.
            When Rocket League came out as free to play, As soon as I switched, I made it out of platinum, through
            diamond,
            and all the way to Champion without losing a single game. I then was stuck in the Champion rank for 14 months until I finally broke through to Grand Champion 1. 2 seasons ago I broke through to Grand Champion 2 but have since dropped back down to low Grand Champion 1. The video below is a montage I made about a year and a half ago.</p2>
