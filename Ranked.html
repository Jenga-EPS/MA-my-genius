        <h1>Rocket League Rank System</h1>
        <img src="Images/rank-tree.webp" alt="Rocket League rank tree" style="width: 50%;">
        <p>Just like every competitive game, Rocket League has a rank tree. Each rank has 3 tiers, and each tier has 4
            divisions. Ranks are tracked using something called mmr (Match Making Rating) and you can gain mmr by
            winning games. Each rank has its own name and color.</p>
        <li>Bronze: The lowest rank, clueless about the game. Associated with bronze or brown</li>
        <li>Silver: The second lowest rank, still sort of clueless. Associated with silver or grey</li>
        <li>Gold: Beginning to understand how to play the game. Associated with Gold or yellow</li>
        <li>Platinum: The most toxic rank, you think you are good but you really aren't. Large growth period. Associated
            with teal</li>
        <li>Diamond: Beginning to get a hold on mechanics such as air dribbles and ceiling shots. Associated with blue
        </li>
        <li>Champion: Starting to get good, you can beat most of the playerbase. Associated with purple</li>
        <li>Grand Champion: This was the old highest rank and used to be every player's dream. You are in the top 1% of
            players. Associated with red</li>
        <li>Supersonic Legend: You are playing against pros and are the best of the best. Associated with White or
            purple</li>
