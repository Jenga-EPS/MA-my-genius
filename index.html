        <p> In Rocket League, players control customizable rocket-powered cars and use them to play
            soccer matches in various arenas. The objective is to score goals by hitting a large ball into the opposing
            team's goal while using a combination of driving skills, aerial maneuvers, and teamwork. The game offers a
            wide range of gamemodes, including casual and competitive play, as well as various customization options for
            cars.

        <p> Rocket League's competitive scene has grown significantly, with professional esports tournaments and
            leagues, including the Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS), attracting top players and teams from
            around the
            world. The game's accessible yet highly skill-based gameplay has made it a popular choice for both casual
            and competitive gamers alike. Currently, there is one player taking RLCS by storm, and his name is Zen. He is a 16 year old French Rocket League player, and is commonly referred to as the best player in the world. Zen made his first, unofficial debut into the competitive rocket league scene in 2020 where he was not allowed to play because he was too young. He recieved a 1 year ban that took effect when he turned 16, and finally, in February 2023, he concluded his debut season by winning RLCS.</p>
