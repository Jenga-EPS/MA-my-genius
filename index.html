            Rocket League is a popular video game that combines elements of soccer (football) with rocket-powered vehicles, creating a unique and fast-paced sports video game experience. It was developed and published by Psyonix and was initially released in July 2015 for various gaming platforms, including PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. Since its release, it has gained a large and dedicated player base and has become a prominent esports title. In Rocket League, players control customizable rocket-powered cars and use them to play soccer matches in various arenas. The objective is to score goals by hitting a large ball into the opposing team's goal while using a combination of driving skills, aerial maneuvers, and teamwork. The game offers a wide range of gamemodes, including casual and competitive play, as well as various customization options for cars. Rocket League's competitive scene has grown significantly, with professional esports tournaments and leagues, including the Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS), attracting top players and teams from around the
            world. The game's accessible yet highly skill-based gameplay has made it a popular choice for both casual and competitive gamers alike.
